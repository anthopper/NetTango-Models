What can be done to help the watermelons survive the fungus? \n\nVideo about how seeded fruit is made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewtlsEb4Vgk&feature=youtu.be\n\nSince the seedless watermelon is grafted and reproduced asexually there is little to no biodiversity which means that a fungus could wipe out the entire population. The seeded watermelon has the ability to mutate and therefore has biodiversity. While the fungus may kill some of the seeded watermelons, the biodiversity will give them a much greater chance of surviving the fungus. The watermelon that survives the population will reproduce and since they reproduce they are likely (but not guaranteed) to have the mutation that allows them to survive the fungus. As the seeded watermelon continues to reproduce, the watermelon with the mutation to survive the fungus will survive but its offspring without the mutation will die. \n\n\n## HOW IT WORKS\nSeeded watermelons reproduce sexually and therefore mutate which causes biodiversity. Seedless watermelons are artificially reproduced asexually through grafting and therefore has a very minimal genetic mutation. If a disease or fungus is introduced to both populations then the genetic variation in the seedless \n\n## HOW TO USE IT\n\nSeeded watermelon (circles of one color) -- reproduce at a rate called reproduction rate (0 to 100) which would be smaller than the reproduction rate of the seedless watermelon. Ability to mutate using a mutation rate (0 to 100). The mutation rate would change the color of the watermelon to show the mutation. \n\nSeedless watermelon (circles of a different color which could be the same or a lighter shade of one of the mutations because a mutation could be the seedless watermelon) -- reproduce at a rate called reproduction rate (0 to 100) which would be bigger than the reproduction rate of the seeded watermelon. Able to mutate using a mutation rate (0 to 100) which would be much smaller than the mutation rate of the seeded watermelon but I would be relying on the student to know this from previous lessons. \n\n## THINGS TO NOTICE\n\nThe fungus or disease is a button that students could introduce at varying times. The fungus is programmed to kill plants of a certain color. That color is randomly selected and can be the color of the seeded watermelon, seedless watermelon, or any of the mutations. The fungus or disease continues to float around via grey spores to spread as soon as it is introduced. It moves around and if it comes in contact with a particular color then it has a certain chance of killing that color\n\n\n## THINGS TO TRY\n\nTrying varying the probability of mutation. Try introducing fungi mutation. How do these effect the proportion of watermelons by color?\n\nWrite what they see in a graphic organizer (still exploring Bozeman to find something I like for this). \n\n## EXTENDING THE MODEL\n\ntry making it so  fungus/disease  kills the plant it comes into contact with only 25% of the time \nAlo, think about alternative means for the fungus  spread from one plant to another and how that could change things?\n\nOne thing to think about is how the genes get passed from the parent to offspring in the sexually reproduced, seeded watermelon. Currently, a watermelon hatches another watermelon with a percent chance their offspring will change color. But, in sexually reproduced plants, parents that survive will pass down half of their genes to their offspring and so we’ll start to see the favored genes that aren’t susceptible to the disease/fungus persevere. But this could involve mixing of colors, or keeping track of lineage. Try extending the model by building some of those features. \n\nThis gene function goes beyond  the scope of what you need to understand in middle school, but it is important in the design of the model, and evolution. \n\n\n## CREDITS AND REFERENCES\n\nKit Martin (2020).
